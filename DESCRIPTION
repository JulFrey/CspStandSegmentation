Description: Functionality for segmenting individual trees from a forest stand scanned with a close-range (e.g., terrestrial or mobile) laser scanner. The complete workflow from a raw point cloud to a complete tabular forest inventory is provided. The package contains several algorithms for detecting tree bases and a graph-based algorithm to attach all remaining points to these tree bases. It builds heavily on the 'lidR' package. A description of the segmentation algorithm can be found in Larysch et al. (2025) <doi:10.1007/s10342-025-01796-z>.
